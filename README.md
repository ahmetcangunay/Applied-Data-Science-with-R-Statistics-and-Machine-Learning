### Programming and Data Science Education with R: Machine Learning and Statistics with End-to-End Applications!

In this training, which is prepared in detail for programming, statistics and machine learning techniques for data science in R,
a lot of information you will need in your business and school life awaits you. This training, which consists of 50 hours and more than 300 course content,
where all techniques are explained in detail, has been prepared on R Studio for those who want to take training from beginner to advanced level.
In our training, we will learn many statistics and machine learning techniques,
both theoretically and practically, using different data sets and different R packages!

## Topics Covered in Data Science Education with R

- **Statistical techniques in R both theoretically and practically**

- **Applying machine learning techniques in R both theoretically and practically.**

- **R Programming for Data Science**

- **Different data structures and data types defined in R**

- **Mathematics and descriptive statistics**

- **Data manipulation**

- **Algorithm and functional programming**

- **Data visualization techniques**

- **Probability distributions**

- **Parametric and non-parametric statistical tests**

- **Analysis of variance**

- **Correlation tests**

- **Loss and outlier checks**

- **Missing observation filling techniques**

- **Transformation operations on data**

- **Normalization and standardization processes**

- **Regularization operations**

- **Model validation and model tuning processes**

- **Different Machine Learning techniques for Regression, Classification and Cluster problems**

At the end of this training, in which almost all subjects are discussed within the scope of statistics and machine learning;
You will be able to master R, data science, statistics and machine learning.
In addition, you will be able to follow the solutions of the problems you have experienced in the subjects described in the training in the Questions From You section as an image.
